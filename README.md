# How to operate??

[![theories](https://img.shields.io/badge/more-theories-purple)](https://github.com/stars/szepeviktor/lists/theory)

I'm planning to restrict my hot stuff on web application manufacturing to this repository only.

It is about how people should behave to produce a robust web application. Sooo emotional!! May hurt your pride.

:bulb: _Every sentence is based on a true story._

## Resources

- a vision
- leadership skills
- persons with knowledge and experience
- time
- funds
- specialized service providers

## Tools

- division of labour (everything should have a master, no orphaned things)
- [documentation](https://youtu.be/F69Mx5LhZ4A?t=372) on service provider accounts
- documentation on architecture of the application
- documentation on testing
- documentation on company procedures (e.g. employee onboarding or termination)
- style guide/brand guidelines
- internal communication regulation

## Tech debt

Question number one: _Is this project worth being proactive?_ (or just be reactive)

- that 5% of resources meaning 1 day per month paying back technical debt
- invest in error-free future

## ðŸ“¢ "The defendant says"

- _I don't have that amount of money!_
- _I need only 1 developer._

## Naming things

Once you give a thing an uninformative name you are ready to start.
Learn more about the thing you have named.
When you know that thing really well and can control it you will find its name.

## Some viktor utopia

- Joy vs. work.
- Adjust your feelings to reality. Be happy about (and use) really great things.
- Loving standards: The nut fits the bolt. Connecting different people.

_It feels so gooood to have this repository ðŸ˜Œ one can write down everything without mentioning names._
