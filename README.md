# How to operate??

[![theories](https://img.shields.io/badge/more-theories-purple)](https://github.com/stars/szepeviktor/lists/theory)

I'm planning to restrict my hot stuff on web application manufacturing to this repository only.

It is about how people should behave to produce a robust web application. Sooo emotional!! May hurt your pride.

:bulb: _Every sentence is based on a true story._

## Resources

- a vision
- leadership skills
- persons with knowledge and experience
- time
- funds
- specialized service providers

## Tools

- division of labour (everything should have a master, no orphaned things)
- [documentation](https://youtu.be/F69Mx5LhZ4A?t=372) on service provider accounts
- documentation on architecture of the application
- documentation on testing
- documentation on company procedures (e.g. employee onboarding or termination)
- style guide/brand guidelines
- internal communication regulation

## Tech debt

Question number one: _Is this project worth being proactive?_ (or just be reactive)

- that 5% of resources meaning 1 day per month paying back technical debt
- invest in error-free future

## ðŸ“¢ "The defendant says"

- _I don't have that amount of money!_
- _I need only 1 developer._

## Naming things

Once you give a thing an [uninformative name](https://github.com/szepeviktor/uninformative-words) you are ready to start.
Learn more about the thing you have named.
When you know that thing really well and can control it, you will find its real name.

## Listening to Viktor

1. If you listen to me, you can avoid bugs throughout the lifecycle of your web application.
2. If you don't listen to me, in a few months you'll find out that the bugs I've pointed out to you are the ones that are causing the damage.

## Some viktor utopia

- Joy of work vs. money.
- Adjust your feelings to reality. Be happy about (and use) really great things.
- Loving standards: The nut fits the bolt. Connecting different people.

_It feels so gooood to have this repository ðŸ˜Œ one can write down everything without mentioning names._
