# How to operate??

I'm planning to restrict my hot stuff on web application manufacturing to this repository only.

It is about how people should behave to produce a robust web application. Sooo emotional!! May hurt your pride.

:bulb: _Every sentence is based on a true story._

### Resources

- a vision
- leadership skills
- persons with knowledge and experience
- time
- funds
- specialized service providers

### Tools

- division of labour (everything should have a master, no orphaned things)
- documentation on service provider accounts
- documentation on architecture of the application
- documentation on testing
- documentation on company procedures (e.g. employee onboarding or termination)
- style guide/brand guidelines
- internal communication regulation

### Tech debt

- that 5% of resources
- invest in error-free future

### ðŸ“¢ "The defendant says"

- _I don't have that amount of money!_
- _I need only 1 developer._

### Some viktor utopia

- Joy vs. work.
- Adjust your feelings to reality. Be happy (and use) about really great things.
- Loving standards: The nut fits the bolt. Connecting different people.

_It feels so gooood to have this repository ðŸ˜Œ one can write down everything without mentioning names._
